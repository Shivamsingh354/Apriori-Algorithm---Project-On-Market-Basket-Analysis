🛒 Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm
📌 Project Overview

This project applies Market Basket Analysis on transactional datasets using the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent itemsets and generate association rules. The goal is to identify products that are often purchased together, enabling better business decisions in areas like cross-selling, promotions, and product placement.

🔑 Key Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning of transactional datasets

Implementation of Apriori algorithm for frequent itemset mining

Generation of association rules with support, confidence, and lift metrics

Visualization of frequent patterns and rules for better insights

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Mlxtend (Apriori, Association Rules)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

🎯 Outcomes

Identified frequent product combinations purchased together

Derived insights to improve recommendation systems and marketing strategies

Demonstrated practical application of association rule mining in retail and e-commerce
